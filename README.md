## Automated query and document analysis
* This code is used to make an automated set of "AND" "OR" queries via pubmed using entrez search.
* The abstract resuts are stored. 
* Document analysis is used to summarise info.
* Pubmed IDs are stored for automated import into citation mananger.

## Why
1. Reproducibly perform queries.
2. Determine which queries are most accurate.
3. Define review questions.

## Some examples of information
* 6 of 300 abstracts contain all of: genomics & metabolomics & proteomics & transcriptomics.
* The most frequent terms in order were: metabolomic, proteomic, transcriptomic, genomic.
* Sepsis and omics = 240 papers for 300 queries.
* Sepsis and omics and pediatrics = 28 papers for 300 queries.

## How to expand
* The number of queries is limited so automation is required to reach the full maximum.
* Test automated queries verses webpage search
